# Prog-Assignment-3

I was unable to complete both of the problems in this assignment.
I have implemented a Concurrent Linked List that will be able to handle add, remove, and search operation.
The reason for more "Thank You" notes than presents could be because some "Thank You" notes were made when the marked for removal but the removal process was not completed.
